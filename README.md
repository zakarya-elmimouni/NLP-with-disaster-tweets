# NLP-with-disaster-tweets
# Description:
This project aims to predict whether a tweet expresses a disaster or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is based on the "NLP with Disaster Tweets" competition dataset available on Kaggle. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets as either related to a disaster (1) or not (0) based on their text content.
